# Dynamic Programming Practice Problems

## Practical Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequence

* **Problem**: Implement a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number. Use
  dynamic programming to optimize the solution.
* **Hints**: Start with the base cases and use either memoization or a bottom
  -up approach to build the solution.

## Practical Problem 2: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

* **Problem**: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine
  the maximum value you can obtain by selecting items with a total weight not
  exceeding a given limit.
* **Hints**: Define the state in terms of remaining weight and available item
  s, and build the solution using a bottom-up approach.

## Practical Problem 3: Coin Change Problem

* **Problem**: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the
  minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount.
* **Hints**: Use a table to keep track of the minimum coins needed for each
  amount up to the target.

## Practical Problem 4: Longest Increasing Subsequence

* **Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest
  increasing subsequence.
* **Hints**: Utilize a dynamic programming table to store the length of the
  longest subsequence ending at each index.

## Practical Problem 5: Minimum Path Sum in a Grid

* **Problem**: Given a grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from
  the top-left to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of the
  numbers along the path.
* **Hints**: Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum path sum for
  each cell by considering the minimum sum of the paths leading to that cell.

## Practical Problem 6: Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)

* **Problem**: Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations
  required to convert one string into the other. The operations allowed are
  insert, delete, or replace a character.
* **Hints**: Define a 2D table where each entry represents the edit distance
  between prefixes of the two strings.

## Practical Problem 7: Subset Sum Problem

* **Problem**: Given a set of positive integers, determine if there is a
  subset with a sum equal to a given target.
* **Hints**: Use a dynamic programming table to explore combinations of sums
  that can be formed with subsets of the given set.
